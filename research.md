## Topics
My research aims to design and analyze **practical attacks** against constrained symmetric primitives, and to improve how we **model, implement, and validate** such attacks.

Key themes:
- **Lightweight cryptography** (design constraints, security margins, implementation trade-offs)
- **Differential propagation & trail search**
- **Key-recovery attacks** (collision-based / enumeration / pruning)
- **Tooling & reproducibility** (C/C++/Python, scripts, artifacts, benchmarks)

## Selected projects
- **[Project A]** — One-sentence description, link to code/paper.
- **[Project B]** — One-sentence description.
